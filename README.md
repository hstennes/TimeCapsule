# TimeCapsule

TimeCapsule is an Android app created as a school project that allows users to shedule a message to be delivered at some point in the future.  The user can specify a date and time down to the minute to send the SMS message. The app uses the Firebase realtime database to store messages and Firebase cloud functions triggered by [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org/en/) to send messages using Twilio at the specified time.
